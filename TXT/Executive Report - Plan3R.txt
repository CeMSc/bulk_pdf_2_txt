Background , Context and  Justification Background In view of the evidence of the tremendous economic and social impact that the health emergency was having in Central America and the Dominican Republic, the Council for Central American Social Integration (CIS)  approved the Second Special Declaration in Ap ril 2020:  United for the Recovery and Social Reconstruction of the Region . This  highlighted the need to start designing, as soon as possible, mechanisms aimed not only at mitigating  the damage but also at laying the foundations for sustainable recovery and social reconstruction; recognizing and addressing those factors that have contributed to th e lack of resilience in the region.   The declaration also recognized the potential of the integration process to support the recovery phase, and that the countries of the region have no other strategic option but to move towards a more sustainable developm ent model where greater integration will help mitigate the effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic.  Rebuilding the region requires multiple and creative public policy responses to support the most vulnerable and cushion the effects of the economic crisis. The pandemic is further accentuating the existing inequalities and hitting the most vulnerable people disproportionately.   In a globalised environment, and amidst factors of uncertainty caused not only by the COVID- 19 pandemic but also by tropical storms Amanda a nd Cristobal and hurricanes ETA and IOTA, integration is a unique strategy that allows our countries to be better equipped to face present and future global challenges and to build a common framework of collective actions to manage them. No country can escape  this crisis alone. The belief that regional work may bring  added value,  turn s into a key factor for the success of this strategy  not only in terms of scale economies that can be fostered through the development of regional interventions, but also in  terms of mutual learning, strength of joint negotiation, the capacity to bring together actors from different sectors and shared regional oversight.   In order to develop this coordinated response, the CIS instructed the Secretariat for Central American Soc ial Integration   (SISCA) to prepare, with the support of the European Union's EUROsociAL+ Programme and in partnership with specialized agencies and programmes of the United Nations, FAO, ILO and UN HABITAT, a Recovery, Social Reconstruction and Resilience Plan for Central America and the Dominican Republic , which would strengthen, from a regional perspective, the processes that facilitate the implementation of  "actions that accompany and guide the gradual return to conditions of the new normality by attenuating social distancing ; actions that make it possible to compensate and/or reverse the social and occupational effects of both the previous freeze on product ion activities and the contagion prevention measures that will continue to be necessary to protect the health of the population ; and actions aimed at strengthening and expanding health and social protection systems in a medium -term perspective".     4 In response to this mandate of the CIS, th e present  Recovery, Social Reconstruction and Resilience Plan for  Central America and the Dominican Republic (hereinafter, the Plan ) consists of a set of strategic projects articulated around 3 axes of intervention: 1) social protection, 2) employability and employment; and 3) informal settlements and sustainable urban development. Each of the projects brings  together strategic and transformative actions  that aim to provide b road and articulated responses to problems prioriti sed by the countries, promoting their revival and recovery, while generating conditions to shape more resilient, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable societies.   The Plan  is established as a common roadmap for the recovery, social reconstruction and resilience of the region, a tool for synergy that seeks to bring together, from a regional integration perspective, the progressive concerted efforts of the eight countries and a wide range of national, regional , and international actors, from both the public and private  spheres  and civil society. In this effort, the Plan  seeks to maximize the potential offered by the area of regional integration and cooperation we share  as members of the region, in order to undertake joint actions that will benefit each country, allowing us to enhance the scale of each action and carry out initiatives that would be more difficult at the individual level. The Plan  also aims to become an instrument of reference for the articulation and mobilization of the political, technical , and financial resources necessary for its implementation. Their i mplementation will necessarily require prior actions that can address the emergency generated by recent climate events, which destroyed the livelihoods of the poorest people and communities in the region, particularly in Nicaragua, Honduras , and Guatemala.  The Plan  is the result of consultation processes held with national referents designated by the authorities of public institutions linked to the social area, by key actors of the SICA countries and technical figures  of the regional integration process; of validation processes and subsequent consensual technical decisions taken within SISCA and submitted for the final approval of the Council for Social Integration (CIS), exercising  the role granted to it by the Central American Social Integration Treaty  (TISCA) as the coordinating and promoting entity of the social integration process , in charge of formulating regional social policy.   The Plan  has been promoted and technically coordinated by SISCA, under the leadership of the CIS, with the concurrence of the Council of Ministers of Labour of Central America and  the Dominican Republic  (CONMINTRAB) and the Central American Council on Housing and Human Settlements  (CCVAH), with the technical support of the European Union's EUROsociAL+ Programme, and the advice of United Nations bodies - FAO, ILO , and UN Habitat.    The door is open for other technical bodies of SICA to formulate new projects associa ted with the main pillars of the Plan or for its integration with  programmes and projects already approved and contributing to the region's recovery .  In particular, th ese include the actions aimed at respon ding to and providing  rehabilitation in relation to the emergency caused by ETA and IOTA, which should, based on a notion of gradualness, be constituted in the phase immediately preceding the implementation of the Plan.     5 Context characterization The pandemic caused by Covid -19 has moved in a short time from a health emergency to an unprecedented humanitarian, economic and social crisis , with final consequences that are still unpredictable due to the continuation of the pandemic and its impacts, both worldwide and in Latin America and the Caribbean.   Pre-existing structural problems have been exacerbated by the effects of the Covid -19 pandemic and the low resilience of countries in the region to the phenomenon . As ECLAC points out1, the different socio -economic impacts of the pandemic reflect the mat rix of social inequality in the region, which is structured around membership of different socio -economic strata or social classes, gender, life cycle stage, ethnic and racial status , and territory, in addition to other factors such as disability, migratio n status and homelessness. The pandemic will further accentuate inequalities, affecting the most vuln erable peopl e disproportionately.   This complex framework has highlighted the weaknesses and fragility of the region's welfare and social protection systems, showing their shortcomings in terms of population coverage, quality and  offer ing of services , and care capacity, and highlighting the precarious conditions in which millions of people live in terms of work and income , and effective acc ess to fundamental rights such as health and education.   Various international bodies point to a strong impact on the economy, with differences between countries, which is explained by unequal exposure to the international context, the intensity of the containment measures and the composition of the economic sectors. According to ECLAC (2020a) the economies of the region will suffer an average contraction of 5.7%, with negative GDP growth rates for all countries.   This unprecedented crisis has led to a fall in family remittances, a collapse in tourism flows, a contraction in international trade flows and a lower inflow of foreign direct investment.  Likewise, the health emergency and containment policies have led to a decline and interruption in the production  and distribution of goods and services, as well as a collapse in private consumption and investment (ECLAC, 2020b).   The crisis in the labour markets has led to a dramatic contraction in employment. The ILO (2020a) places the region as the most affected g lobally in terms of lost work ing hours  and labour income (in the second quarter of 2020 alone it estimates a  loss of working hours, equivalent to 24  million full-time jobs). The organization also emphasizes that a high percentage of jobs in all countries are located in the economic sectors expected to be most affected by the economic crisis, a figure that represents 36.7% of the region's employment, 8.3 million workers. By the end of 2020, the IDB (2020b), facing a scenario of prolonged recession, projects an average formal job los s of 22.2% , where the service sector, a key sector in the region, will be singularly affected.    1 ECLAC, COVID -19 Special Report , 12 May 2020.     6 The effects of the pandemic also deepen existing gaps in terms of inequality of income and quality of employment, being especially negat ive among people working in the informal sector, a sector which, in 2018, accounted for an average of 63.5% of employment in the countries of the region.  Informality is associated with low income and job insecurity and makes workers more vulnerable to eco nomic fluctuations. Although the crisis is affecting the entire labour force, women, young people, indigenous people, Afro -descendants , and migrants are being particularly affected, given their high participation in some of the sectors most at risk from the crisis, such as the service sector or unskilled self -employment (IDB, 2020b). The Gini Coefficient, which measures the inequality of the overall income distribution, is expected to increase by between 1.0% and 5.9% in the countries of the region (ECLAC, 2020g).   Tropical storms Amanda and Cristobal, which were followed by hurricanes Eta and Iota -  category 4 and 5 respectively -  have con tributed to the deepening of inequality and inequity gaps in the region, making the emergency caused by the pandemic more complex. These natural phenomena have caused the destruction of homes, access infrastructure and services, having a profound impact on  the livelihoods of many people, and particularly affecting the most vulnerable groups, including women, indigenous people , and Afro -descendants.   The concatenation of climate emergencies has had devastating effects on the region, making the management of the pandemic even more complicated. The destruction of health infrastructure has increased the pressure on a care system already stressed by COVID- 19. The states, which are also experienc ing fiscal stress, have limited financial resources for provid ing comprehensive responses to such a complex situation.  Articulating responses to the pandemic: leaving no one behind At this juncture, the role and presence of the State becomes central on several fronts: on one hand, it must seek to mobilize and guarantee reso urces for subsistence and access to basic services; on the other, it must mobilize and guarantee resources and generate the best possible conditions to foster economic revitalization and the reconstruction of more inclusive, egalitarian and resilient socie ties (ECLAC, 2020a). The countries of the region have implemented major fiscal, financial, employment and social security and public service packages aimed at containing the spread, mitigating the economic impact, protecting employment,  and ensuring the li quidity of households and the business sector.   COVID -19 has been a fundamental test of resilience for societies, economies , and governance worldwide and it has confirmed  the impossibility of finding outlets and solutions within national structures alone. A s ECLAC stresses (2020b), the role of the region's integration will have to be reinterpreted at a time of profound changes that are shaking the foundations of the economy, society , and international relations. These changes require heightened and improved integration, a framework of respect for multilateralism and international rules, which will facilitate the fulfilment of the SDGs and the economic and social development of small countries such as the Central American states .     7 Intensifying  the int egration process will be important to face this and future crises, fostering joint actions in areas where there are regional public assets  and where joint action is more beneficial than individual action. Re- interpreting the role o f integration begins with  identifying the changes and challenges the region is facing following the COVID -19 pandemic. Th e crisis represents a turning point f or the current development model and an opportunity to build a better future. Reconstruction must not only be eco nomic but also social . It must take place under the premise of "rebuilding better" and "leaving no one behind".  Public policies which will be implemented during the recovery and reconstruction process will have a decisive influence on the development path that the region will follow. In a globalised world, more robust integration is a response to the present, but also a response to the future.   As noted in the SICA's 2020 -2040 Comprehensive Regional Social Policy: Integrating through Social Inclusion,  the region as a bloc has the political will to move forward, and has the institutional, economic, scientific and technological capacities needed to effectively and comprehensively eradicate or neutralize the main factors that cause and reproduce multidimen sional poverty, exclusion and social marginalization; particularly socio -economic, territorial and gender inequalities, insufficient income, lack of employment, production  and educational opportunities, insufficient coverage of social protection and securi ty systems and of basic social services, access to adequate housing, and the negative impacts of climate change, the occurrence of adverse natural phenomena, and epidemics and pandemics.   The purpose of th is Plan is  to contribute to that willingness to succeed .      8 2. Prioritisation Criteria, Strategies , and Approaches Prioritis ation criteria Both the identification process and the choice of strategic projects ha ve been guided by the prioritisation criteria defined in the CIS’s Second Declaration , namely: • Relevance for the revival,  recovery and generation of conditions for creating resilience , favouring structural reforms oriented to sustainability  and generati ng the institutional conditions for the continuity of the measures.   • Regional character, with the pursuit of  joint solutions to common problems of interest to all countries .   • Contribution to the achievement of the objectives of regional sectoral policies , including the articulation and complementarity  of the project’s instruments of intervention, and its alignment with the objectives and goals covering the economic, social and environmental spheres of the Agenda 2030 within the framework of the SDGs.   • Ability to e ncouraging the bringing together  of public, private and civil society institutions and organizations  (national or cluster) around projects.   • Ability to b enefit broad sectors of the population, taking special care of the most vulnera ble population groups  that experience multiple forms of exclusion and have suffered most acutely from the socio -economic impacts of the crisis (among others, women, young people, and indigenous peoples; unemployed, underemployed, precarious workers).   Strat egies and approaches Within the logic of the prioriti sation criteria, the Strategic Projects, in their design process, integrate strategies and approaches that seek their effective contribution to the reconstruction, revival and resilience of the countries in the region.     • Regional integration approach • Multi -sectoral approach • Territorial approach • Alliances, relationship and complementarity with other programmes and activities of other donors • Gender equity mainstreaming  • Focus  on youth • Intergenerational approach • Human rights approach • Intersectionality • Interculturality • Integrated approach to environmental sustainability.      9 3. Axes of Intervention and Strategic Objectives The general objective of the Plan is to " articulate public sector responses to the social, labour and land -use problems of human settlements and urban development in the SICA countries from a regional integration perspective, in the phases of post -COVID social and economic recovery. " The Plan cover s three main areas of intervention: 1) Social protection, 2) Employability and employment; and 3) Informal settlements and sustainable urban development. Each axis has defined its own strategic objectives, to whose achievement the strategic projects will contribute.   Strategic projects, as to ols of operational planning, define the objectives and results to be achieved, concrete lines of action and the most appropriate strategies in the current context that will allow for comprehensive and articulated responses to prioritized problems in  order to contribute to recovery and reconstruction in the short to medium term, and to realize potential emerging opportunities for the generation of resilience in the region .    Overall intervention logic AXIS  Main strategic objectives  STRATEGIC PROJECTS  Strategic objectives of the projects Axis 1. Social protection  a) Promoting and implementing gradual processes that incorporate the immediate horizon of short- term needs and advance the strengthening of the governmental capacities of the States b) Promoting processes that lay the foundations for universal, integrated , and robust social protection systems to guarantee the right of the Central American population to a life free from poverty and to inclusive and resilient development.  Promoting the integrity of the programmatic offer ing to guarantee quality services for vulnerable populations with a rights -based approach.  • Promoting comprehensive nature of the programmatic offer ing in Central American countries to guarantee the delivery of services fr om a rights - based  perspective, advancing systematically in the consolidation of a minimum social protection floor.

Axis 3.  Informal settlements and sustainable urban development  a) Fighting urban inequality and segregation by focusing efforts on increasing inclusive and resilient urbanization, for which creating appropriate planning frameworks has proved essential.   b) Incorporating the potential of the now informal settlements into urban formality.   c) Fostering the safety of the most disadvantaged urban spaces, mitigating the risks to which they are largely exposed or relocating those that cannot be mitigated.   Regional neighbourhood improvement programme focused on informal settlements ( PREMBAI ) with an integrated risk management approach through the implementation of an inter - institutional and  community -based management methodology.  • Contributing to the creation of resilient communities, through the promotion and development of comprehensive neighbourhood improvement program mes that contribute to the reduction of the housing deficit and the risk of climate events .   Regional mapping of informal settlements wi th a diagnostic and planning approach and community base supported by digital training of the communities.  • Generating information and inputs that contribute to decision making in urban and ter ritorial policy including concrete actions that improve the live s of residents in popular settlements.   Strengthening of public policies to foster municipal competencies and means of action in urban and territorial planning processes  • Strengthening municipal bodies in their autonomy to implement public policies in the  urban and territorial context      11 Plan implementation phases The Plan, in its aim to contribute not only to countering the negative social effects of the health, economic and social crisis unleashed by the COVID -19 pandemic in the region, but also to the imperative need to " generate resilience in the region in the f ace of different adverse phenomena2, incorporates a notion of gradualness, which takes into account three major moments:  a) Addressing the emergency and rehabilitating livelihoods Given the emergency situation that the SICA region is facing as a result of the succession of climatic emergencies superimposed on the COVID -19 pandemic, the implementation of the Plan will require a prior phase that organizes and leads the States' respons e to the current emergency and is directed at humanitarian as sista nce and initial rehabilitation; this phase must enable them to move on to a situation of stabilization that lays the foundations for recons truction and resilience.   In this preliminary phase, the actions will be aimed at covering the most urgent needs, allo wing the recovery of people's livelihoods and the revival of the social fabric; while at the same time restoring the affected infrastructure and basic services and making the first efforts to reactivate the production  chains.   The institutionality of each of the SICA countries, as well as the relevant bodies within the regional integration system, are already organizing the actions needed to complete this phase, which is the first step on the road to implementing the Plan.   For Axis 1, these actions will ha ve different concretions. Efforts should be made to update registration systems and review the programmatic offer ing of social protection, as well as to identify and characterize, as priority subjects, the population groups most affected by the climate emergency. Targeting criteria should be integrated into the registration system for future emergencies.   In turn, the provision of food services should prioritize the groups most affected by the climate emergency (children, adolescents , and female heads of hou sehold) in the most affected territories and from there initiate processes of psychosocial support and community resilience.   2 Government of Costa Rica.

In: https://www.presidencia.go.cr/comunicados/2020/11/america -central -hace -historia -al- suscribir -primera -politica -social -regional/  Addressing the emergency and rehabilitating livelihoods Laying the foundations for resilient interventionsDeveloping and strengthening interventions and changes   12 It is vital at this stage to identify the community actors who will implement the actions aimed at unleashing and/or strengthening the resilience processes. Communicational actions for behaviour al change regarding  care work and the relative redistribution of roles begins at this stage.   In this phase, the actions of Axis 2 aimed at strengthening the employment services and the retraining of skills can play an important role in facilitating and supporting the search for and recruitment of the labour force needed for the reconstruction itself. In order to facilitate the articulation of employment demand and offer, it will be key to quickly identify the different production  areas, from a territorial perspective, that are likely to generate employment. In this sense, it will be strategic to id entify possible labour needs in the countries of the region that cannot be met by the national offer ing, to enable  the consequent mobilization of workers from other countries in the region.   In the area of labour migration  governance, the pursuit of  mechani sms for regular labour migration is key at this stage; thus, the establishment of agreements and conventions with countries of destination for migration, linking demand and offer  of labour; and support for training in countries of origin based on the skill s required at the destination, facilitating the certification of migrant workers’ diplomas and skills. It will be necessary to expand the actions already under way in the search for agreements to confirm and expand the TPS, such as the systematic search fo r sources of temporary employment abroad, the linking of offer and demand between the countries most affected by the climate emergency and the developed countries that need labour in specific sectors, and on which progress has already been made 3.   In orde r to promote the recovery of livelihoods, Axis 2 actions aimed at production for basic food provision should be promote d, incorporating production chains related to this work. This production should be generated under criteria of environmental recovery and  sustainability of communi ty production units, and oriented to the generation of social resilience, laying the foundati ons for future ac tions.   In this phase, the actions of Axis 3 related to the geo -referenced knowledge of the territories are of special interest, prioritizing the identification of the communities at greatest risk of extreme climate events, and most suitable for guiding  the interv ention of the neighbourhood improvement project.   The re -establishment of infrastructure and basic services, of vital importance in this phase, will require inter -institutional coordination, anticipating the actions of the projects of municipal  3 "The Ministers of Labour of Central America and the Dominican Republic have recently highlighted th e need for a Regional Agreement on Labour Migration, which would be a very significant step forward and a strategic action in the recovery phase in order to boost the Central American economy and labour market".

The inter -institutional and multi -level coordination mechanisms created in this emergency phase will pave the way for leading planning focused on the miti gation of all risks, especially those related to the context of climate change and environmental vulnerability.   At this stage, existing planning guidelines in the region should be reviewed from an emergency perspective, which will provide basic guidelines  for the reconstruction of facilities and services in safe conditions in the short, medium , and long term, thus beginning the work of resilient planning.   b) Laying the foundations for resilient interventions At this stage it will be necessary to establish an agenda of government commitments, defining a management strategy for the Plan, as well as a roadmap, which will give continuity to the previous phase of post -emergency rehabilitation, identifying and taking into account the affirmative actions that each co untry can take, to guarantee social protection coverage that will promote the generation of resilience, in a unique way, in the most vulnerable population.   The Plan's management strategy and its roadmap, at the national and regional levels, should make it  possible to align and articulate public action around the priority interventions in social protection projects, which will require the participation of both public and private actors and international cooperation.   Guaranteeing and reaffirming the rights to education, health, work, housing , and social protection is the most important challenge of this second stage. Interventions in this phase must focus on vulnerabilities, not only those generated by the pandemic and the climate emergency, but also those t hat are structural. Thus, priority should be given to actions aimed at women, indigenous and Afro -descendent peoples, children and young people, and the population living in conditions  of poverty .  In this phase, the actions of Axis 1, taking into account the results of the previous phase, aim to move towards expanding the coverage of services and effective access to them for the groups identified as being the most vulnerable.    From Axis 2, actions will be promoted to seek the socio -labour insertion of vulnerable people and groups, the development and strengthening of their capacities and competencies as the members of value chain production  units, in terms of employability, self- employment and decen t employment.   The projects of Axis 3 will foster the identification of institutional routes, at municipal, national and regional level for strengthening public policies and municipal authorities  in the field of land use and urban planning, in o rder to minimize climate risks, which are central to the current context of climate emergency and favour the reduction of the inequality and inequity gaps that have deepened in the context of the con vergence  of the pandemic and the emergenc ies caused by ET A and IOTA.     14 This sheet should also identify the areas in which it is necessary to strengthen public institutions, as well as the relative actions and allied actors, particularly those of cooperation, needed in order to proceed  in either deepening or unlea shing the processes.   c) Developing and strengthening interventions and changes In this phase, technical instruments will be developed and strengthened to institutionalize the universal social protection model, as well as a system of integrated employment ser vices for labour inclusion and the identification and promotion of value chains, giving priority to the rural environment and the most vulnerable members of the population. This instrument will also aim to creat e and consolid ate the Regional Neighbourhood Improvement Programme focused on informal settlements, with an integrated risk management approach.   Ensuring sustainability will depend on the clear and precise identification - in the processes of policy formulation -  of territorial, sectoral , and institutional planning; programming and pre - investment and public investment. Now is the time to commit to the funding of actions through national budgets.    Gaps must be identified in care policies at the national level, using a syste mic and comprehensive approach , incorporating all populations requiring care, and articulating this with economic, employment, health, education, housing , and social protection policies, based on the promotion of social and gender co -responsibility.   All in tersectoral and territorial actions should be articulated in national social protection systems, from their design to monitoring and evaluation. This will require deliberate processes of articulation between public policies and actions for social protectio n, and between these and education, health, employment, housing , and land -use planning policies.   It is in this phase that the States of the region will have the capacity to universalize and expand coverage definitively, as well as to organize the programm atic offer ing in accordance with the different emergency situations that may arise,  in light of the linkage between social protection and integrated disaster risk management, for the construction of resilience.   Targeting criteria will be updated and will be able to address health crisis scenarios, improving and strengthening systems beyond emergencies. The process will take into account emerging vulnerabilities and others that relate to factors beyond multidimensional poverty, that is, from an intersectiona l approach and regarding  complex contexts.    Axis 1: Social Protection A fundamental reference is made to the strategic projects of Axis 1 . Social Protection  in the policy instruments available to the CIS -SISCA, notably  the Regional Integral Social Policy PSIR -SICA 2020 - 2040 and the Regional Intersectoral Agenda on Social Protection and Productive Inclusion with   15 Equality, ARIPSIP 2018 -2030 . The projects are th e result of the systematization and analysis of the results of the rapid consultation carried out with national institutions in charge of social protection, as well as civil society entities with thematic relevance and international cooperation agencies an d key actors in the SICA region.   The projects address elements of a structural nature, corresponding to the national and regional context . From the notion of gradualness, these incorporate the immediate horizon of short -term needs, but seek to unleash proc esses that strengthen the governmental capacities of the States and lay the foundations for universal, integrated , and robust social protection systems that help to guarantee the right of the Central American population to a life free of poverty and to inc lusive and resilient development. It is under this notion of gradualness that the project profiles have been elaborated, recognizing the diversity of the countries , and identifying their potential for complementarity and mutual learning. They all develop and consolidate existing processes for strengthening and expan ding  social protection systems in terms of social inclusion and cohesion.   Gender mainstreaming is considered central to the projects, implying  the specific consideration of women's practical and strategic needs and addressing pre- existing gaps and those generated by the pandemic in all areas of intervention. The projects will ensure equal access to and control over resources and benefits, and they will boost the empowerment of women. The y are also in line with the general notions of PRIEG/SICA.   Similarly, the project associates its objectives and activities with the call of Agenda 2030  for Sustainable Development for Latin America, putting inequality at the centre of the work of the projec ts of this axis. In addition, in the effort to advance towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -now at high risk of not being met due to the social impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic -, actions are articulated to promote and foster social inclusion hand - in-hand with economic growth and the environmental dimension of our societies, so the projects associate their actions with various objectives4.

Each of these is defined by its nature and mandate, the development field to which it refers and the level of operational intervention it carries out.    Summary Following the effects of the pandemic, the countries of the region have considered the need to guarantee a basic social protection floor , while moving towards universal access schemes. On the other hand, it has become clear that the system should be suffic iently capable of adapting to emergencies so that it is able to prevent the effect of shocks caused by health, environmental and anthropogenic emergencies on family livelihoods and to address other groups affected by various vulnerability factors, such as violence against women and children, criminal violence, catastrophic diseases, irregular migration status, sexual orientation and identity, and the effects of climate change, among others.  The crisis should turn into an opportunity to strengthen care policies within the region, using a systemic and comprehensive approach, incorporating all populations requiring care, while articulating with economic, employment, health, education , and social protection policies, based on the promotion of joint social and gender responsibility.   The challenge of this project is to generate processes of family and community resilience  for people in conditions of poverty and extreme poverty, reducing their exposu re and vulnerability to any emergency, through comprehensive interventions that take into account the structural and conjunctural determinants of the crisis, but first ensure  their access to basic services.   The guarantee of the right to education is the fa ctor that will ensure the consolidation of learning processes for chang ing behaviours and will enhance the possibility of common and collective responses, which contribute to the construction of social cohesion and build resilient communities. Access to ed ucation for school- age children poses challenges that are particularly linked to the reform ation  of traditional education models, which are linked to face -to-face education and the digital divide.   This project of social responsibility for  care and community resilience is an intervention carried out in the family space, at community level; and that, through complementary components of various types, will seek to address the complexity of the main problems that have arisen in the context of the pandemic and the lockdown. It allows the deployment of a comprehensive care system that offers support and aid to the most vulnerable women and families, to address gaps in education, potential events of domestic violence and violence against women, the prevention of child labour and obstacles to obtaining quality food.  In operational terms, all countries agree that implementation should take place, in the first instance, in the regions where actions are already under way. If, as a result of the process  of reviewing the programmatic offering  and the targeting criteria that occur within the framework of the other Axis 1 project, this is extended, then the project will be expanded towards those other regions or groups. Those criteria should cover the aspec ts linked to the social responsibility of care, as well as to ensuring access to education for girls and boys, including those belonging to the intraregional migrant population who are stationed and in line with the other project of Axis 1: Promoting the   17 integrity of the programmatic offer ing to guarantee quality services for vulnerable populations with a rights -based approach.

Summary of the project Social protection is a central policy for the reduction of inequalities , progress towards social inclusion and inclusive growth, and hence for social cohesion. Within this framework, the project seeks to gradually and systematically support the strengthening of the social protection systems of the countries involved, in order  to make sustained progress towards this objective, while recognizing the differences between them.  The gradual nature of the process is marked by the following key moments: • Phase 1. Addressing urgencies and laying the foundations for resilient interventions In this phase, it will be necessary to design an agenda of government commitments, by defining a roadmap of affirmative actions to ensure the availability of a programmatic offering  that enables the countries to address the vulnerabilities of  the different target groups and , at the same time,  reorganizes the offering  to respond to new vulnerabilities as an effect of the pandemic. This roadmap should identify the areas of the programmatic offering that need to be strengthened, as well as the actions that will give rise to a new offering , defining  the institutionality and the relative actors  required  in this process, in order to proceed in  either deepen ing or unleash ing the processes .  The establishment of national and regional strategic guidelines to organize, coordinate and articulate public action on the basis of social protection policies is the objective of this roadmap, which will require the participation of both public and private actors and international cooperation.   At this initial stage, it is important to identify, by means of information and knowledge managem ent processes, the main gaps in care, both at the level of populations and in the areas most affected by the pandemic: education, health, work and social protection.   Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups: women, the population of indigenous peoples and Afro- descendants, children , and young people, and those living in poverty who are particularly vulnerable because of violence, especially violence against women.   • Phase 2. Developing and strengthening interventions and changes In this phase, progress will be made towards the progressive strengthening of social protection in order to establish the basis for universal access to education and health, including other sectors.  Technical instruments will be developed and strengthened to insti tutionalize the universal social protection model in all the countries of the SICA region, in order to guarantee rights, improve the existing system and generate   20 opportunities for vulnerable populations. The revision, updating and optimization of the user registration systems will be the main instrument to be addressed, in order to generate a virtuous circle with the integral programmatic offering  adjusted in the previous phase.   Supporting the strengthening of registries and promoting quality information will contribute to better decision - making and adequate targeting of social policies.   • Phase 3. Consolidat ing the institutionality of the actions and thus guarantee ing sustainability : In this phase, all intersectoral and territorial social protec tion actions should be articulated in national social protection systems, from their design to follow -up and evaluation. This will require deliberate processes of articulation between public policies and actions for social protection and between these and education, health, employment, housing policies.   The States involved in this process will have the tools and capa bilities  to universalize and expand coverage definitively, as well as to organize the programmatic offering  according to the different emergin g problems and/or to the analysis of others; in light of the linkage between social protection and integrated disaster risk management, for the construction of resilience.   Targeting criteria will be updated and will be able to address health crisis scenarios, improving and strengthening systems beyond emergencies. It will take into account emergin g vulnerabilities and others that relate to factors beyond multidimensional poverty, that is, from an intersectional approach and regarding  complex contexts .   Objective of the project  Promoting the comprehensive nature of the programmatic offer ing in Central American countries to guarantee the delivery of services from a rights -based  perspective, advancing systematically in the consolidation of a minimum social protection floor.   Specific Objectives • SO1.  Identifying in each of the countries involved, the detail of the programmatic offering  aimed at taking care of people, families , and communities in a situation of vulnerability .  • SO2 . Building institutional capacity for the development of integrated social protection systems .  • SO3 . Characterizing the user registration systems in each of the countries involved .  • SO4 . Identifying and describing the targeting criteria used by countries for the delivery of services and benefits .  Expected results • R1.1. Definition of  a roadmap (identification, reorganization and/or updating of programmatic offer ing, comparative analysis, identification of gaps) constituting a work plan to guide the implementation of the process gradually and according to its characteristic s and potential.   • R1.2.  An integrated programmatic offering  will be defined and agreed upon to facilitate the achievement of the goal of a minimum social protection floor and/or minimum guaranteed income.  • R.2 Implementation of learning processes and ability  and capacity building for inter -country technical teams in identifying good practices, analysis of progress .   • R3. Definition  and characteriz ation of  a robust user registration system, which includes the criteria of integrality of the programmatic offering  and allows the identification of potential users, based on the updating of existing and emerging vulnerabilities.   • R4. Implementation of exchange and  learning processes among countries on targeting criteria,  with technical teams highly committed to the proposed adaptations and transformations and to the competencies and skills to execute them.     21 Lines of action • Line 1.  Preparation , identification and characterization of the programmatic offer ing by country based on a set of previously agreed criteria.  • Line 2.  Proposal for reorganization and/or updating of programmatic offering , where applicable. Comparative analysis of the offering  between countries to verify possible regulatory, administrative or management adjustments.   • Line 3.  Identification of gaps based on  new emerging vulnerabilities and on specific characteristics such as: life cycle, gender,  and ethnic distinctions, etc.   • Line 4.  Characterization of user registration systems to identify their potential for expansion and/or the adjustments required to supp ort the implementation of an integrated social protection offer.   • Line 5.  Updating of targeting criteria, where appropriate, to achieve full consistency with the programmatic offering  and the adjustments implemented to the user registration systems.   • Line 6.  Information gathering, description and analysis of institutional capacities in each country to provide a baseline for identifying capacity and skill gaps in order to implement an integrated programmatic offering process. This action will allow the identification of barriers and obstacles and the relevant measures to overcome them.   • Line 7.  Implementation of a process of reciprocal and collaborative learning between countries to identify good practices, collectively analyse progress and build the capacities and abilities of the technical teams in charge.    Target group/population The target group of this initiative is people subject to social protection, who, on the basis of the work done, will be able to benefit from a comprehensive programme offering that contributes to and guarantees the protection of human rig hts and provides a minimum floor of social protection and/or a guaranteed minimum income. Basically it gathers: vulnerable families who are CCT beneficiaries; female heads of household; people with disabilities; older adults; children and adolescents; indi genous peoples and Afro- descendants.   Complementarity with policies/agendas/strategies • Comprehensive Regional Social Policy PSIR -SICA  2020 -2040 • Intersectoral Regional Agenda on Social Protection and Productive Inclusion with Equality, ARIPSIP 2018 -2030 It is articulated with regional and national policies, agendas and strategies that establish the key sectoral and cross -cutting intervention frameworks.   Risks and contingencies • A worsening of the effects of the pandemic on the population • A deterioration in government al fiscal conditions resulting from the emergency faced and lack of economic recovery .  • Weak political commitment from governments to carry out the project .  • A workload of the technicians involved that does not allow t heir effective participation .  • A change in the political administration of the State involving a change in priorities .     22 Axis 2: Employability and E mployment The project ideas presented in relation to Axis 2 -  Employability and Employment fall within the framework of goals and strategies agreed upon by the political bodies, especially the Action Plan of the Council of Ministers of Labour and the  Comprehensive Regional Social Policy PSIR -SICA 2020 -2040 , along the lines of some previous projects, for example the project on Strengthening Integrated Systems of Training, Guidance and Labour Integration (FOIL , Formaci ón, Orientación e Inserción Laboral ) and the results of the consultations carried out  with institutional references and key informants in the  Central American region.   At the same time, the crisis is pushing to accelerate some reforms that would otherwise meet insurmountable resistance: in addition to articulating passive and active policies, as well as strengthening and integrating employment services, active employment policies will have to extend their scope and operations to the business sector and accompany recovery plans. The image is that of an ecosystem that virtuously connects social income protection, labour market policies and economi c policies.   The project profiles prepared propose action in the field of employability and employment that will provide protective measures to address vulnerabilities from a social perspective, generating actions that will prevent a deepening of poverty and inequality.   The projects specifically include the gender approach, considering the differentiated practical and strategic needs of women or men, addressing the pre- existing gaps and those generated by the pandemic and climate impacts in all areas of int ervention. The projects will ensure equal access to and control over resources and benefits, and it will boost the economic empowerment of women.  The projects are also in line with the general notions of PRIEG/SICA.   The projects also associate their object ives and activities with Agenda 2030 , putting inequality at the centre of their work; and they also articulate their actions with the Sustainable Development Goals with the aim of fostering and encouraging social inclusion to go hand in hand with economic growth and the environmental dimension of the region5.   Project 1/Axis 2:  Recovery of employment, self -employment, labour skills development and income for  vulnerable population sectors in strategic value chains, giving priority to the rural area:  cocoa- chocolate processing and marketing and food production segments (vegetables and fruit)   5 SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 2: Zero Hunger, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, SDG 12:  Responsible Production and Consumption, SGD 13: Climate action, SDG 15: Life on Land, SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals   23 Country/Coun tries  Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama , and Dominican Republic Responsible institution(s)  • SISCA • Council of Labour Ministers (CONMINTRAB) Participating institutions   • Labour Ministries and Secretariats • REDIFP and Central American members of the Network • SECAC • Executive Directorate of CENPROMYPE • SIECA and bodies they represent as deemed appropriate National entities of different types are involved in the project implementation process. Each of these is defined by its nature and mandate, the develop ment field to which it refers  and the level of operational intervention it carries out.    Summary The project proposes to implement a new way of approaching the value chains, so that the economic result is the consequence of a training and work program that generates quality and innocuous products, optimal for commercialization by the members of the Productive Units . Additionally, the latter will generate dignified self - employment and will be able to generate quality jobs , not only in the rural areas, but in all the territories involved under the selected chains.   The Productive Unit  (PU) will be the focus of the project's actions, and it will consist of people grouped by common interests , that may b e family, proximity , collective  interests , or others , which  allow them to work together to achieve predetermined obje ctives. The PU will be made up of 20 members, who assume a serie s of commitments, among others: rece iving the training agreed upon with the different trainers, dedicat ing themselves to the development of their productive unit, actively participat ing in the development of the planned labour activities , guaranteeing  quali ty products or services, and giv ing priority to the marketing of their products through the links identified in the chains.   PUs can focus on any of the selected links in the chains, however, the project will prioritize two key areas: 1) the links dedicated to the processing of cocoa into chocolates and those for food products  (vegetables and fruits) as raw materials into processed products, and 2) the marketing of all products generated during the various processes.   Since the beginning of the process, the PU s of the production links are connected  with the processing and marketing links, to facilitate the channelling of the production towards the markets, and they will do it directly or through the well- known " anchor companies"  that can use  their experience to provide support in the commercial and/or industrial aspects, and qualified suppliers.   In this process, the role of the Labour Ministries or Secretariats is fundamental, as they must facilitate the incorporation of other public and private entities acting as articulators of the required actions, and facilitating contacts with the different organizations in the participating countries . These will provide technical assistance, facilitate commercial tasks, and ultimately contribute to the generation of opportunities to be materialized in real jobs that will improve the living conditions of the people in the territories where the productive units are inserted.  The intervention logic  foresees three phases to be executed in 12 months, which will be replicated during the years of the project's duration, implementing any necessary adjustments.   • Phase I: Improvement of production skills.     24 The responsibility for executing Phase I lies with the teams of trainers.  Previously, contacts will be pursued with the different  Vocational Training Institutes , to evaluate their interest in participating in said training and education processes. Since the original model was put into place at  SENA (Colombia), the transfer of the methodology by this vocational training institution to others in the region who wish to take over its implementation will be addressed, with the project providing the resources for the payment of trainers and other costs arising from the transfer of the model.   • Phase II: Strengthening of the skills more related to the management of the business.   PU members will receive training on production and management, with subsequent specialization of some trainees.  It is expected that the trainers will be integrated into the different Business Development Centres existing in the region and operating under the Small Business Development Centre  (SBDC) model.   • Phase III: Advice and support .  The PUs will receive advice and support regarding issues such as obtaining sources of  funding, focusing on increasing sales or optimizing administrative processes. At the end of Phase III, a complete cycle of the proposed value chain model will be completed, which can be validated and  which,  in order to ensure that it has the necessary viability to be a company that generates jobs, is sustainable and generates development in the territory.    Objective of the project  Improving the development and strengthening of the capacities and competencies needed by the members of the productive units of value chains to generate the best conditions of employability, self -employment and productive employment, and decent jobs.   Specific Objectives • SO1. Improving the capacities of the members of the productive units and their families in terms of income generation, employment , and assured food supply • SO2 . Providing the training required to acquire the necessary skills for the basic processing of products in the cocoa and food chains (vegetables, fruits).   • SO3 . Training the members of the productive units so that they can adequately manage their PUs, know and manage their production costs and obtain products in competitive market conditions.   • SO4 . Strengthening the transformation and commercialization links to ensure the placement in the markets of the products generated in the other links of the chain.      25 Expected results • R1.1.  Improved socio -economic conditions of the members of the productive units and their families, and increased income generation and food provision for the members of the Productive Units.   • R1.2.  Reduced rural unemployment rates and reduced migration from rural areas to urban belts, especially of young people and women, through the employment opportunities generated by their insertion in the production, processing and marketing processes of products generated in the productive units and value chain.   • R2. The ne cessary training processes for quality and safe products will be carried out, as well as the skills required for the basic processing of products in the chains • R3. The members of the productive units will be trained so that they can adequately manage their PUs, know and manage their production costs and reach marketing channels in competitive market conditions.   • R4. Processing and marketing links will be strengthened to ensure the proper placement onto the markets of the products generated in the other link s of the chain.   Lines of action • Line 1 :  Creation of Productive Units as a centre of income generation for the nearest community, generation of self -employment, entrepreneurship , and quality jobs. The approach prioritizes attention to PUs over attention to  individual entrepreneurs.   • Line 2 : Facilitation of the insertion of producers from predetermined chains into the value chains, to ensure the adequate marketing and/or processing of the products, either directly or through "anchor companies".

Summary of the project The project aims to address, in a systemic and integrated manner, the main criticalities of the public employment systems providing the active policies mentioned above. In this direction, two macro areas are identified in which the activities envisaged in the project are developed: • On the offer  side, regarding jobs and active employment policies :  reference is made to activities aimed at strengthening public employment services, with  a mix ed incorporation of technology and renewed methodologies and instrume nts for the provision of services, specializing in both actions dedicated to strengthening people's employability, and in the placement of the most vulnerable population; • On the demand side , regarding  jobs  and active employment policies : reference is made to the need to ensure that an increasing number of enterprises (especially micro and SMEs) turn to the public employment services to meet their requirements of strengthening/updating the skills of their human resources and recruiting people with appropriat e profiles to meet their job requirements.   The project includes different lines of action that are complementary and mutually supportive, based on the principles of flexibility, progressiveness and modularity necessary to make activities adjustable to dif ferent national contexts. For this purpose, 2 main dimensions are defined: • regional approach  of the project : it will be necessary to prioritize common contents in the definition of operational and organizational standards shared at regional level, including progressive exchanges between countries and with other international experiences; • national approach  of the project : development of the project activities according to a national prioritisation system  and contents defined with each participating country, taking into consideration characteristics of specificity and context (central, regional, territorial), specific needs of each country, according to the starting   27 point and progressiveness (schedule) est ablished with each one in relation to the programmatic offer ing of the common operational and organisational standards.   General objective of the project  Contributing to the recovery of the labour markets and their resilience in Central America and the Do minican Republic, favouring the insertion of vulnerable people and groups  into society and employment .  Specific Objectives • SO1. Supporting the processes of strengthening and modernizing national, central and territorial public employment services (with a view to integration into regional standards) in order to achieve an offer of employment services in line with the needs of individuals and enterprises; • SO2 . Improving the provision  of labour market information (updated, verified and reliable) from labour market observatories and from the prospecting activities of market intelligence units for feedback and effective operational improvement of employment services and to meet the needs of the production  sector; • SO3 .

Encouraging an agenda for the reduction of the digital divide in the field of work with a gender perspective to improve access to the digital labour market through training and employment services; • SO5 . Strengthening and disseminating infrastructure to improve effectiveness and efficiency by strengthening connectivity and reducing the digital div ide for individuals and employers.   Expected results • R1. More efficient and modern employment services and systems  will exist  in each country and according to a regional vision, these will respond to the needs of people and employers / enterprises, and fo ster inclusion of the population  into society and employment , especially you ng people, women and vulnerable people; • R2. Improvement in  the quality of the offering based  on a prospective analysis of the labour market that feeds back the effectiveness and efficiency of the employment services and satisf ies the needs of operators in the production  sector; • R3.

Role of Labour Ministries in managing labour migration at national, regional , and extra- regional levels; • Line 4. Agenda for the reduction of the digital divide in labour insertion with a gender- based approach;   28 • Line 5. (Transversal) Creation of conditions for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the digital infrastructure for connectivity and bridging the digital divide.   Target group/population The target group for this intervention are the most vulnerable people in the workplace: • Unemployed , migrant population (both within countries and regionally), disadvantaged and vulnerable people, women, young people, individuals  with disabilities and adults.   Besides people, employers and enterprises also account for another target group of th is project idea, as their needs for competences and occupational requirements will be given specific attention to facilitate the labour inclusion of the above mentioned people.    Complementarity with policies/agendas/strategies • Action plan of the Council of Labour Ministers , in particular with results 2, 3 and 4 • SICA's Comprehensive Regional Social Policy  (PSIR -SICA) 2020- 2040, especially with strategic objectives 3, 5 and 6 • Intersectoral Regional Agenda on Social Protection and Productive Inclusio n (ARIPSIP ) 2018 -2030 , in particular with strategic lines 2 and 4 • Regional Policy on Gender Equality and Equity  (PRIEG ) in particular with strategic axis 1 • It is mentioned that, due to its objectives and contents, the present project is developed in continuity with the lines of activities of the project Strengthening Inte grated Systems of Training, Guidance and Labour Insertion TGLI/ILO 2010- 2014.   Risks and contingencies • Change of priorities and factors that may influence progress in the construction of dialogues, pacts and decision making among the main actors of the processes; • Excessive dispersion and fragmentation of national dimensions which hinder the processes; • Barriers and conditionality of different kinds  (legal, budgetary, administrative and conjunctural) that hinder and/or condition the construction of alliances, consensus and shared visions that can affect the implementation of innovation and modernization processes.       29 5.3 Axis 3: Informal S ettlements and Sustainable Urban Development The existence of informal settlements is a common reality throughout Central America that appears as a challenge to be faced in both national and international agendas, expressing in all of the se the commitment to implement effective solutions to the housing problem in which the inclusion of adequate housing and an environment that allows for integrated and healthy development is increasingly clear. In addition to this ch allenge, which is central to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda, there are the urgent issues raised by COVID -19, which has shown its most harmful side to suffer ers, deepening social inequalities manifested in gender -based gaps and in global phenomena such as the feminization of poverty.   It is a reality that cities and their neighbo urhoods pose a far -reaching challenge in the coming times. The complexity of the problems that the region will have to face is a major fact or, but so are the possibilities for improvement and for reducing the socio -spatial and gender gaps that are widening so strongly.   The proposed project profiles seek an approach to different scales of planning and management with a single objective, to op timize the structures of territorial, metropolitan, urban and neighbo urhood planning to achieve an improvement in the most vulnerable neighbo urhoods and contribute decisively to resilience processes in the countries of the region.   The projects specifically include the gender approach, considering the differentiated practical and strategic needs of women and men, addressing the pre- existing gaps and those generated by the pandemic and climate impacts in all areas of intervention. The projects will ensure equal access to and control over resources and benefits, and it will boost the empowerment of women. The projects are also in line with the general notions of PRIEG/SICA.   The projects also associate their objectives and activities wit h the call of the Agenda 2030  for Sustainable Development for Latin America, putting inequality at the centre of their work; and in the same effort to advance towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG s), they articulate actions that  promote and encourage social inclusion hand -in-hand with economic growth and the environmental dimension of our societies, so the projects associate their actions with various objectives6.     6 SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 2: Zero Hunger, SDG 5: Gender Equality, SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 13 Climate action   30 Project 1/Axis 3. Regional neighbourhood improvement programme focused on informal settlements (PREMBAI) with an integrated risk management approach through the implementation of an inter - institutional and co mmunity -based management methodology  Country/Coun tries  Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama , and Dominican Republic Responsible institution(s)  • SISCA • Central American Council on Housing and Human Settlements (CCVAH) Participating institutions   • Ministries and Secretariats responsible for Housing, Human Settlements and Land -Use Planning,  Communications and Infrastructure • Municipalities and governments • Competent institutions in precarious settlements, Social Protection and Development, Territoria l Studies and Statistics, Disaster Reduction and Risk Control, at regional and national level • Competent institutions for the prevention of violence • Institutionality in favour of women in each country and STM- COMMCA • Enterprise institutions, universities an d research centres and NGOs • UN Habitat  Summary of the project The Regional Programme for Neighbourhood Improvement focused on Informal Settlements  (hereinafter PREMBAI , Programa Regional de Mejoramiento Barrial Centrado en  Asentamientos Informales ) aims to deploy a series of tools focused on the drafting of Urban Plans , with an integral approach (hereinafter Integrated Urban Plan or IUP ) and that considers risk management, incorporating the key issues  that already appear in  the national documents with which the Programme intends to be aligned: 1) adequate housi ng, 2) mobility, 3) infrastructure, equipment and urban layout, 4) connectivity, mobility and sustainable transport, 5) environmental management, protection and recovery, 6) public services, 7) land tenure, 8) coexistence and culture of peace, 9) equipped, safe  community centres and public spaces, incorporating security for women and girls, 10) resilient and intelligent communities, 11) strengthening identity, 12) food security, 13) education, training and production and 14) community participation and social appropriation of the program.   PREMBAI's intervention logic is based on a methodology centred on planning and institutional articulation through the (i) constitution of an inter- institutional working and commitment table (ii) collection and use of sufficient information for project prioritization, (ii) coordination of the programmatic offering  of public, private and community institutions that act in the t erritory, and (iii) follow -up and monitoring through a series of indicators to be defined in advance and that will point directly to the objectives set in each context.   The intervention system will be based on the coordination of public investments and th e encouragement of private ones, with strong community participation, especially of indigenous groups and women, incorporating any minority or especially vulnerable groups detected in each country.   The intervention  methodology will be implemented by stages , in order to adapt to the conditions and situations of each of the countries to be incorporated into the regional programme, and through an intense co- management process w ith main items focus ing on (i) the active participation of local governments, for which an agreement will be drawn up with the municipalities, (ii) the elaboration of a Plan of Action that includes the concrete intervention strategy and (iii) the execution of the IUPs that will take place in an inter -institutional way  with the participation   31 of at least the central, local and private governments and the active participation of the communities and the private sector, guaranteeing gender mainstreaming in its implementation.   PREMBAI will make it possible to establish a com mon methodology for the region  and to move forward supported by those projects, program mes or policies existing in the region that incorporate it: • Mainstreaming of affirmative policies on women and their living conditions • Considerations on the risk situation regarding  climatic events • Vision of territorial and urban planning All this will result in the preparation of specific planning documents in each of the countries, incorporated and adapted to the normative and legal structure of each country, and a seri es of documents, guides, regional toolboxes, which will collaborate in the transfer and dissemination of the knowledge acquired and allow, in the medium or long term, the implementation of neighbo urhood improvements.

Strengthening of public policies to foster municipal competencies and means of action in urban and territorial planning processes Country/Coun tries  Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama,  and Dominican Republic Responsible institution(s)  • SISCA • Central American Council on Housing and Human Settlements (CCVAH) Participating institutions   • Ministries and Secretariats responsible for Housing, Human Settlements and Land -Use Planning • Institutions competent in Territorial Studies and Statistics, Disaster Reduction and Risk Control • Institutionality in favour of women in each country and STM- COMMCA • Municipalitie s, Governments, Associations of Municipalities and Metropolitan Areas • NGOs and Neighbo urhood and Community Associations , especially  those  led by women • Enterprises, foundations , and cooperatives working in the field of neighbourhood development • Coordination Centre  for the Prevention of Disasters in Central America and the Dominican Republic | CEPREDENAC • Central American Commission on Environment and Development | CCAD • Enterprise institutions, universities and research centres and NGOs • UN-Habitat   Summary This proposal is aimed at strengthening local governments for the promotion of effective urban planning processes, land management and the generation of equipped, safe, sustainable,  and resilient urban environments, with gender -based mainstreaming.   To this end, the updating of the regional guidelines or toolboxes focused on urban -territorial planning centred on the resilience of the territories will be undertaken . This  will continue with a national technical cadre training process  that will allow for a strategy of dissemination and reinforcement of municipal technical and regulatory knowledge, in the logic of training trainers, and it will be implemented through the promotion of join t technical support spaces that can provide service to several municipalities and allow for an increase in the effectiveness of territorial development, if necessary. In other cases it will be supported by existing territorial structures (metropolitan, ass ociations of municipalities...) or by the municipalities themselves, if they have certain capacities.   The spaces of support to the municipalities will have to be intersectoral and multilevel in order to facilitate the communication with the superior levels  and to step up to their role as facilitators of the urban development processes.       34  Objective of the project  Strengthening municipal bodies in their autonomy to implement public policies in the urban and territorial context.   Specific Objectives • SO1. Generat ing guidelines updated for future regional projects in the area of land use and urban planning, seeking improvements in the effectiveness and implementation/consolidation of projects for neighbou rhood improvement and the provision of basic services, which are central to the fight against the pandemic, the minimization of climatic risks and the reduction of the gender gaps that have widened in this context.   • SO2 . Training and technically reinforcing supra- municipal administrations for the dissemination of the results in the municipalities that are lagging behind in this aspect.   • SO3 . Generating and/or reinforcing intermunicipal and intersectoral decision -making spaces.   Expected results • R1.1 Improvement of inter- institutional and inter- sectoral relations in the field of land and urban planning • R1.2.  Increase in the number of municipalities that have concrete tools for zoning and land management (POM) with a gender- based approach.   • R2. Improvement of training for land and urban planning technicians on the dissemination of information to be provided to municipalities to improve their autonomy.   • R3. Improvement of municipal technical and management training on territorial and urban planning with a gender- based approach.   • R4. Increase in the incorporation of municipalities into planning processes in an aut onomous and effective way.   Lines of action • Line 1 : Support in the generation of sustainable and resilient urban, intermunicipal and metropolitan policies, with a gender perspective and consideration of the climate emergency, that strengthen local institutions and their regulatory framework.  • Line 2 : Production of regional technical documentation focused , among other  thing s, on the climate challenges of the current context, and its dissemination (manuals, guides, regulations), with strong, medium and long -term links to equitable urban development and social justice.   • Line 3 : Creation of inter -institutional, inter -municipal and metropolitan, intersectoral and multi- level management spaces in which local community structures are incorporated.    Risks and contingencies • The technical and financial weakness of the municipalities, in the area of territorial planning, detected in many of the countries may have a negative impact on the implementation of the programme.   • Technical and professional teams might not have an adequate handling of the gender approach for its mainstreaming.   Target group/population This project directly benefits urban and territorial decision -makers by improving technical skills and autonomy.   It also indirectly addresses the population, as beneficiaries of the controlled urban planning that could derive from its implementation, and of the improvement in the functioning of the institutions, as a backlog to be solved prior   35 to (or in parallel  with ) the implementation of concrete and affirmative actions that improve the life of residents in situation s of disadvantage and vulnerability.    Complementarity with policies/agendas/strategies • Comprehensive Regional  Social Policy (PSIR -SICA ) 2020 -2040 • Intersectoral Regional Agenda on Social Protection and Productive Inclusion with Equality (ARISIP) – 2030 • Regional and national policies, agendas and strategies  that establish the key frameworks for sectoral intervention in human settlements, land management, urban planning, decentralization, etc.   • Equality policies at the country and regional levels     36 Project 3/Axis 3. Regional mapping of informal settlements with a diagnostic and planning approach and community base supported by digital training of the communities Country/Coun tries  Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama , and Dominican Republic Responsible institution(s)  • SISCA • Central American Council on Housing and Human Settlements (CCVAH) Participating institutions  • Ministries and Secretariats responsible for Housing, Human Settlements and Land -Use Planning • Institutions competent in Territorial Studies and Statistics, Disaster Reduction and Risk Control, Environment • Social Development Ministries and Secretariats • Institutionality in favour of women in each country and STM- COMMCA • Municipalities, Governments, Associations of Municipalities and Metropolitan Areas • NGOs and Neighbo urhood and Community Associations , especially those led by women • Enterprises, foundations , and cooperatives working in the field of neighbourhood development • Coordination Centre  for the Prevention of Disasters in Central America and the Dominican Republic | CEPREDENAC • Central American Commission on Environment and Development | CCAD • UN Habitat • Enterprise institutions, universities and research centres and NGOs  Summary of the project The aim of th is proposal is to identify  the dimension of the urban challenge regarding  informal settlements faced by the different countries, understanding that these spaces are in the centre of the priorities of the urban - territorial policies. Th is will help to prioritize the eradication of poverty, and hence its feminization, and the provision of healthy environments, as described both in the New Urban Agenda and in the strategic guidelines of each of the countries that make up the region.   The data collection and processing methodology , already tested in the region, would have a quantitative approach, similar to that of a census, that is, the collection would have to be applied to the entire universe of study that would be the informal settlements.  To this end, the data structure to be collected would have to be designed to focus on those aspects that define the spaces as informal: i) connectivity, ii) tenure, iii) access to basic services, into which others relating to iv) age, v) natural en vironment, vi) relations with the territory would be incorporated. It is important to emphasize that , prior to the effective collection of the information , there would be a group  phase in which all the data from official institutions would be collected (census, statistical institutes , cadastres and all the information that the participating institutions could offer) as well as other information acquired prior to the concrete collection of data such as the t racking of aerial photos or any situated  information that the local leaders themselves could provide.  Contact with the communities will be central and necessary from the beginning, since the project will have to be communicated and the training of the communities themselves will have to be simul taneous, with special   37 emphasis on women, so that data collection through digital applications is done from the community itself. This will allow us to undertake a triple objective, training in digital skills, generating employment and allowing the appropriation of the tool by the local communities, facilitating its  maint enance  in the medium and long term, by increasing and updating the inputs in a systematized way.  The information generated, disaggregated by sex and other variables of interest, will allow t he prioritization of spaces and the improvement of the impact of the projects. It could also be the seed of a regional observatory on urban vulnerability, which would make it possible to evaluate the medium and long -term effectiveness of the neighbourhood improvement processes currently implemented in the region. The information collected regionally will also be delivered to the Coordination Centre for the Prevention of Disasters in Central America and the Dominican Republic (CEPREDENAC ) for incorporation i nto the situation table prepared by that entity, wh ich could be the repository of the information.   In this way, a system for incorporating regional inputs would be created , supervised by a regional entity, with equitable community participation of women an d men from all social conditions present in each context . This would improve the process of digitalization and digital training, as a relevant aspect shown to be central by the COVID -19 pandemic, with special emphasis on the digital inclusion of women.    Objective of the project  Generating information and inputs that contribute to decision making in urban and territorial polic y, including concrete actions that improve the lives of residents in popular settlements.   Specific Objectives • SO1.  Implementing projects that allow the information generated in each location to be collected with a focus on planning in a communitarian and truthful way in order to make it  directly useful for territorial and urban planning.   • SO2. Training communities, especially local leaders, to be part of the process (ICT training) .  • SO3 . Coordinating the inputs generated in each location and municipality to achieve unified regional data.   Expected results • R1.1.  Generation of inputs and information on urb an challenges • R1.2 . Generation of a statistical tool with a gender- based approach, useful for political decision -making and territorial and urban techniques • R2. Digital training for communities and employment generation in data collection carried out and improved, with active and binding participation of communities in the process, considering equity between women and men in their diversity • R3. Opportunities will be identified in the municipalities and the capacities of the municipalities will be strengthened in the management of territorial inputs with a gender perspective • R4. Creat ion of  a common regional framework and a similar regional data collection methodology for monitoring urban vulnerability that incorporates the gender perspective.   Lines of action • Line 1 : Line 1: Generation of a regional georeferenced mapping tool that allows countries, regions, metropolitan areas , and municipalities to implement projects to find out the location, number and characteristics of informal settlements and their inhabitants, enabling ri sk assessment of these spaces.     38 • Line 2 : Training of communities so that the mapping process can be taken over by the community itself.  Incorporating monitoring through the definition of concrete, simple and measurable indicators, evaluation , and transparent  review by community leaders • Line 3 : Connecting this tool, of a regional nature, with the needs of the municipalities so that it can guide public policies and actions, including urban planning and management processes, making it possible to make vulnerabilities visible, prioritize investments and measure impacts on baselines, from a gender perspective.    Target group/population The main beneficiar ies addressed by  this project are those responsib le for  making decisions in the urban environment, facilitating the task thanks to the generation of inputs. In this sense, that is, as users of information, other groups such as academics and researchers will also be beneficiaries.   In addition, the project addresses the population in a direct way, as participants from the community base in the mapping of their community and the maintenance of information, and in an indirect way, as beneficiaries of the planned and controlled neighbou rhood improvement process that  could derive from its implementation: • Population of women and men in their diversity, living in popular neighbourhoods with degrees of informality • Community leaders • Equitable population of women and men in their diversity , to train on digitalisation -related issues related.

Thinking about financing: Bicentennial Fund for Social Resilience (FS R/SICA) The Recovery, Social Reconstruction and Resilience Plan for  Central America and the Dominican Republic constitutes an articulated response by the countries of the region to the enormous socio -economic impacts that the pandemic is causing. The 7 strategic project profiles that make up the Plan are the result of a broad consultation process carried out by SISCA, with the support of a team of experts from Latin America and Europe made available by the European Union's Eurosocial pr ogramme, with the valuable participation of technical teams from the Ministries of Social Development, Labour and Housing of the SICA countries, together with advice from FAO, ILO, and UN -Habitat.   In the following weeks, these profiles and their subsequent development into detailed projects will unleash their full potential as instruments for the mobilization of the technical and financial resources needed for social recovery, thus helping to complement the national efforts already underway that are limited in scope by the complex fiscal situations countries are facing. Similarly, with the support of the General Secretariat of SICA, it is expected that strategic alliances will continue to be encourag ed and established with and among regional institutions, national bodies, including civil society, the private sector, academia,  and international partners that wish to contribute to the development of the Plan as a binding element  of the  determination and technical and financial efforts needed to create a more resilient region characterized by  peace, democracy , and development.  The Plan constitutes a reference tool for the mobilization, in the short term, of external resources to complement national invest ment. The external resources to be attracted to finance both the projects of the Plan and new projects that may be added , or complementary national actions, may include in their nature the figure of international cooperation funds or national loans.   When  drawing up the Plan, the consultation activities performed included dialogu ing with financial actors, international cooperation and private companies, and as a result of these approaches, within the framework of the process of analysing financing alternatives, an idea inspired by the European initiative of the Next Generation EU 7emerged .  Along the se lines, SISCA, with the technical support of the European Union's EUROsociAL+ programme, proposed the creation of a Regional Fund for Social Resilience  - to be name d the Bicentennial Fun d for Social Resilience  (FSR /SICA ) - as a financial instrument that would make it possible to channel additional or complementary resources to social, employment and housing policies that target population  7 The Next Generation EU fund is a package of instruments for Europe's recovery and resilience, of an extraordinary and temporary nature (2021 -2024). Its purpose: the development -oriented econom ic recovery of the countries affected by the crisis on the common EU agenda, i.e: (i)  Economic, social and territorial cohesion; (ii)  Economic and social resilience; (iii)Mitigation of the social and economic impact of the crisis; and (iv)Green and digital  transitions.     40 groups in poverty and extreme poverty, and present risk factors and greater econo mic, enviro nmental and social vulnerability in the region. The Bicentennial Fund for Social Resilience (FSR/SICA) , in addition to being an instrument with which  countries can finance the necessary reforms of their social protec tion systems, is  a concre te model of solidarity and integration between nations and partners (see profile) and an alternative mechanism that can help continue to enhanc e the valuable and strategic role played by  the Central American Bank for Eco nomic Integration (CABEI) . The CABEI  acts as the finan cial arm of the integration and economic development of the SICA re gion, which promotes the balanced economic and social development of Central America and the Dominican Republic and which , to this end , has already been supporting differe nt nation al and regional initiatives of a social nature.   COVID -19 gives us the opportunity to foster a more united, inclusive, egalitarian, sustainable and resilient Central America. It is important for all of us to work together to start the implementatio n of this Plan as soon as possible, which, through short -term actions, has its sights set on a horizon that goes beyond recovery and vindicates the aspirations embodied in the founding instruments of our Regional Integration System.  BICENTENNIAL  FUND FOR SOCIAL RESILIENCE - FSR Context and foundations The pandemic caused by Covid -19 has moved in a short time from a health emergency to an unprecedented humanitarian, economic and social crisis with final consequences that are still unp redictable d ue to its continuation and its impacts, both worldwide and in Central America and the Dominican Republic . The pandemic leaves the Central American region with discouraging social and economic indicators. Poverty, extreme poverty , and inequality are increasing in all countries, further  weakening social cohesion. In this complex context, the weaknesses and inadequacies of the region's welfare and social protection systems have been highlighted, albeit with significant differences be tween countries.    The severity of the crisis, worldwide, is greater or lesser according to the degree of robustness and comprehensiveness of national welfare systems. This is also the case in Europe. In our region there are important deficits related to population coverage, quality and supply of services and attention capacity. All this aggravates the precarious conditions in which millions of people live in terms of work and income, and effective access to fundamental rights such as health or education.   At this juncture, the role and presence of the State becomes central on several fronts: 1. It should seek to ensure resources for livelihoods and access to basic services; 2. It must mobilise resources and boost initiatives for the revival of the economy and employment.     41 3. However, it must also seize the opportunity to strengthen its social resilience through the modernisation of national social protection, employment and vocatio nal training and education systems.   To date, countries have put in place valuable relief packages aimed at containing the spread, mitigating the economic impact, protecting employment,  and ensuring the liquidity of households and the business sector. Howev er, looking ahead, the three challenges mentioned above are addressed from complex fiscal situations, with compromised  fiscal sustainability . In addition, the downturn in economic activity has had a negative impact on tax revenues, which have declined shar ply while , at the same time,  public expenditure has grown rapidly to cope with the social and economic effects of the pandemic that have triggered public debt. Hence the need for extraordinary interventions from integration mechanisms, multilateralism , and intra - and international cooperation.   Bicentennial Fund FSR Inspired by the European initiative of the Next Generation EU , considering the common tradition of regional integration and the difficulty of finding outlets and solutions only within the framewo rk of national structures, SISCA, with the technical support of the European Union Programme EUROsociAL+, proposes the creation of a Regional Fund for the Social Resilience of Central America and the Dominican Republic - FSR (Bicentennial Fund) .    This is a financial instrument that makes it possible to channel additional or complementary resources to social, employment and housing policies that target population groups in poverty and extreme poverty, and which present risk factors and greater econo mic, environmental and social vulnerability in the region. This is a Fund that, for the first time, puts the social dimension at the centre, i.e. policies to develop resilience (protection systems, reduction of inequalities, improvement of human capital, etc.), through which countries can gain the capacity to face crisis situations and progress towards higher levels of (inclusive) development.   In this perspective, as in the European case, the Bicentennial Fund cannot be used to finance subsidies or tax redu ctions, but rather reforms and investments. The areas to be financed correspo nd to the three identified by the Council for Central American Social Integration -CIS for the Recovery, Social Reconstruction and Resilience  Plan .   The Fund may be financed by  various public and private sources, by  international cooperation and by  cooperation from the region itself.    Regional Fund for Social Resilience in Central America and the Dominican Republic - FSR (Bicentennial Fund).    Responsible institution(s) CABEI, CIS/SISCA   42 Other institutions Financing (USD) US$1 billion8  Extraordinary and temporary fund to support countries to finance social resilience, articulated in 2 pillars in 3 areas:   Social protection  Employment  Housing and Settlements (A) Reforms and investments at national level (B) Services and common actions between countries What is the Fund ?  A financial instrument that allows SICA countries to implement  reforms and make investments aimed at social resilience, or common collaborative initiatives between countries for the benefit of different national realities.  Public policy objectives 1. Expansion and strengthening of integrated systems of social protection services .  2. Articulation of employment systems capable of supporting skills training, labour inclusion (in particular of women and young people), labour mobility and formalisation.   3. Neighbou rhood improvement with an integral vision focused on informal and popular settlements.   Cross -cutting areas - Gender Equality - Green Transition - Digital Transition     Process The Fund finances: (A) National Programmes (Reforms and investments at national level).    8 Amount subject to increase by agreement of the Member States.    43 (B) Multi -country projects (Services and common actions between countries).   It remains to be established whether the FSR covers as many grants and loans or only the former. And if there is to be co -funding.   In order to access the FSR, the national ministries or entities and the Regional Governments respond to the CABEI call and prese nt program mes and/or projects in the three public policy objectives indicated.   For the formulation of the programmes and/or projects to be evaluated, the following criteria must be met : • COMMON REFE RENCE FRAMEWORK: Recovery, Social Reconstruction and Resilience Plan for  Central America and the Dominican Republic • REGIONAL GUIDELINES: will be elaborated by SISCA with the support of the European Union's EUROsociAL+ Programme; they refer to format, methodology, governance of the implementation phase, etc.  • PURPOSES: only (1) Reforms and investments at national level and/or (2) Services and common actions between countries. The FSR cannot be used for cash benefits assigned to individuals or tax relief. All programmes and projects must include measures in the 3 cross -cutting areas identified.  • TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: for the formulation of the program mes and projects the countries can count on the technical assistance of the European Union Program EUROsociAL+.   • GRANTING OF FUNDING: - Evaluation of draft programmes an d/or projects by the FSR technical task force.   - Final presentation of programme and/or project proposals .  - Evaluation by the CABEI -SISCA Committee and approval (with the support of external experts) .  - Advance of 20% of the financing.   - Review of progress on goals and results.   - If positive, disbursement of second allotment of financing (50%).   - Repetition of the review schedule for the third and last financing allotment (30%).   - Final evaluation.   Governance Governing Board The Governing Bo ard of the FSR, as the entity responsible for its strategic direction, would be made up of CABEI, Ministers of Social Development, representatives of civil society, representatives of international cooperation and financing agencies of the Fund.   The FSR Gover ning Bo ard will be responsible for approving national programmes and/or multi- country projects submitted for application to the Fund.
